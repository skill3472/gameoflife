## What is Game Of Life?
You can read more about Conway's Game of Life [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It's a simple cellular automaton, based on really simple rules written by John Horton Conway in 1970.

This is a very simple and barebones and crude application for seeing random "live" and "dead" cells interact with each other.
